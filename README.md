# Redesigning Online Discourse 💬🌐  

## Overview  
This project explores ways to improve online discussion spaces, where comments often fall into shallow exchanges, toxic behavior, or disinformation. Many news outlets and platforms have shut down their commenting systems because moderation is too costly. Our goal is to rethink how online conversations can be structured so they remain constructive, meaningful, and inclusive. ✨  

## Problem 🚨  
- Online comments are often low-quality, uncivil, or dominated by extreme voices.  
- Shallow, one-off reactions make it hard to form real dialogue.  
- Moderation costs have forced platforms to remove commenting entirely, reducing opportunities for public discourse.  

## Research Goal 🎯  
To build **constructive public discussion at scale** by encouraging participants to engage with **considerate and diverse perspectives**. Instead of one-off replies, the system guides users into multi-level, structured discussions that highlight both agreement and disagreement.  

## Approach 🚀  

### 1. Commenting Pipeline 📝  
- **Awareness & Comprehension** – conversations are divided into subtopics, each reflecting different perspectives.  
- **Opinion Formation** – participants engage in **integrative deliberation**, where different viewpoints are synthesized rather than ignored.  

### 2. Multi-Threaded Discussions 🧵  
Instead of a single flat thread, discussions unfold in **parallel streams**:  
- **Synchronous discussions** – real-time exchanges within subgroups.  
- **Asynchronous discussions** – participants can add curated comments later.  
- Each subgroup develops a set of viewpoints, which are then aggregated to find common ground and clarify differences.  

### 3. Three Levels of Discussion 🪜  
To structure the flow, the system operates across **three levels**:  
- **Level 0** – Writing and clustering comments.  
- **Level 1** – Reviewing clustered comments and creating new discussion threads.  
- **Level 2** – Summarizing discussions, highlighting common grounds, and identifying differences.  

This layered model ensures that conversation moves from raw comments → organized themes → integrated perspectives.  

### 4. Discourse Visualization 🔍  
- Shows how conversations branch into subtopics.  
- Connects scattered viewpoints into a visual map of relationships.  
- Helps participants see not just individual comments but the larger flow of perspectives.
